# Architectural Tactile Graphics Guidelines

VERSION: 1.0
LAST_UPDATED: 2025-12-26
STATUS: Living Document - Refinement Through Testing

---

## 1. Overview

### Purpose

This document provides guidelines for converting architectural images into tactile graphics suitable for PIAF (Picture In A Flash) production. It serves two audiences:

1. **Human readers**: Architecture students, educators, and accessibility specialists who need to understand tactile graphic principles
2. **LLM agents**: AI systems that analyze architectural images and invoke the Image-to-PIAF tool with appropriate parameters

### Scope

Covers all visual materials encountered in architecture education:
- Studio work (plans, sections, elevations, sketches, models)
- Structures courses (load diagrams, stress fields, connection details)
- History/theory (photographs, drawings, site plans, maps)
- Technical systems (environmental diagrams, fabrication drawings)
- Data visualization (charts, graphs, simulations)

### User Context

PRIMARY_USER: Blind/low-vision architecture student
ACADEMIC_LEVEL: Sophomore
CURRENT_COURSES: Structures, Design Studio
BRAILLE_PROFICIENCY: Grade 2 (contracted) - fluent
GOAL: Self-sufficiency in creating and interpreting tactile graphics

---

## 2. Pattern Integration

### System Architecture

```
WORKFLOW:
  Image → Image-Description-Machine → LLM Analysis → Image-to-PIAF → Tactile PDF
```

### Component Roles

**Image-Description-Machine** (patterns/image_description_machine/)
- Generates Macro/Meso/Micro descriptions of architectural images
- Identifies medium type, materials, spatial relationships
- Extracts text present in image
- Provides context for tactile conversion decisions

**This Document** (ARCHITECTURAL_TACTILE_GUIDELINES.md)
- Decision framework for LLM agents
- Parameter selection logic for Image-to-PIAF
- Category-specific conversion rules
- Quality criteria for tactile output

**Image-to-PIAF** (fabric-access CLI tool)
- Converts images to high-contrast black/white
- Applies text detection and Braille conversion
- Handles tiling for oversized images
- Generates print-ready PDF for PIAF machine

### LLM Decision Flow

```
1. Receive architectural image
2. Apply Image-Description-Machine pattern
3. From description, determine:
   - Graphic category (see Section 4)
   - Complexity level (simple/moderate/complex)
   - Text density (none/sparse/moderate/dense)
   - Required simplification (if any)
4. Select Image-to-PIAF parameters using this document
5. Invoke tool with appropriate options
6. Validate output against principles (Section 3)
```

---

## 3. General Principles

### ABSOLUTE RULE: No Overlapping Information

```
CRITICAL: Tactile elements that overlap become unreadable when PIAFed.
         This applies to:
         - Braille labels over original text
         - Line work crossing at multiple points
         - Dense hatching or stipple patterns
         - Symbol keys placed over drawing content
```

ENFORCEMENT:
- The Image-to-PIAF tool automatically repositions overlapping Braille labels
- Labels that cannot be repositioned are omitted with a log message
- Original text regions are whited out before Braille placement
- Simplification must be applied to overly dense drawings

### Preserve Original Scale

RULE: Maintain the scale of the original drawing unless:
- Paper size constraints require tiling
- User explicitly requests a different scale
- Critical detail would be lost at original size

RATIONALE: Architecture students must develop accurate scale intuition. Changing scale without notification undermines spatial reasoning.

### Braille Standards

PREFERRED_GRADE: 2 (contracted)
RATIONALE: User is fluent in Grade 2; contracted Braille is more compact, reducing overlap potential

BRAILLE_PARAMETERS:
- Grade 2 for all text conversion
- Minimum 3mm between adjacent labels
- Labels positioned below original text location when possible
- Maximum label length: 40 characters (longer text summarized or split)

### Color to Pattern/Texture Conversion

Colors cannot be represented tactilely. Convert using:

| Color Purpose | Tactile Representation |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Differentiation | Distinct line patterns (solid, dashed, dotted) |
| Hierarchy | Line weight variation |
| Emphasis | Texture density variation |
| Zone indication | Boundary lines with texture fill |

CURRENT_LIMITATION: Automatic pattern detection not yet implemented. LLM should describe color-coded information in accompanying text description.

### Simplification Transparency

RULE: When simplification is applied, explain:
1. What was simplified
2. Why simplification was necessary
3. What information may have been lost
4. How to access the original if needed

FORMAT:
```
SIMPLIFICATION_APPLIED:
  - [Element]: [Original] -> [Simplified]
  - REASON: [Tactile clarity / Density reduction / Overlap prevention]
  - INFORMATION_LOSS: [Description of what is no longer distinguishable]
```

## 4. Graphic Categories

### CATEGORY: Floor Plans

IDENTIFIER: Horizontal section through building showing walls, doors, windows, rooms
TYPICAL_SOURCE: CAD exports, hand drawings, textbook figures
PRESET: floor_plan
THRESHOLD: 140-150
ENHANCEMENT: s_curve (strength 1.0)
PAPER_SIZE: letter (small plans) or tabloid (complex plans)
KEY_FEATURES:
- Wall thickness critical for tactile recognition
- Door swings must be clear
- Room labels essential
- Furniture usually simplified or omitted

### CATEGORY: Sections

IDENTIFIER: Vertical cut through building showing floor levels, ceiling heights, structure
TYPICAL_SOURCE: CAD drawings, construction documents
PRESET: section
THRESHOLD: 145
ENHANCEMENT: s_curve (strength 1.2)
PAPER_SIZE: letter or tabloid based on building height
KEY_FEATURES:
- Cut material (poche) must have distinct texture
- Level lines need clear spacing
- Dimension strings important for structures coursework

### CATEGORY: Elevations

IDENTIFIER: Orthographic view of building exterior, no perspective distortion
TYPICAL_SOURCE: CAD drawings, measured drawings
PRESET: elevation
THRESHOLD: 135
ENHANCEMENT: s_curve (strength 1.0)
PAPER_SIZE: letter
KEY_FEATURES:
- Window patterns show rhythm
- Material indication simplified
- Ground line must be clear

### CATEGORY: Structural Diagrams

IDENTIFIER: Load paths, force diagrams, moment diagrams, connection details
TYPICAL_SOURCE: Structures course materials, engineering documents
PRESET: technical_drawing
THRESHOLD: 150
ENHANCEMENT: none (line work should be clean)
PAPER_SIZE: letter
KEY_FEATURES:
- Arrow direction critical (loads, reactions)
- Line weight indicates force magnitude
- Support symbols (pin, roller, fixed) must be distinct
- Dimension annotations essential

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATION: Force diagrams often use color to show tension vs compression. LLM must describe this in text since tactile cannot differentiate.

### CATEGORY: Site Plans

IDENTIFIER: Building footprint in context of site, landscape, adjacent structures
TYPICAL_SOURCE: Planning documents, design presentations
PRESET: site_plan
THRESHOLD: 140
ENHANCEMENT: s_curve (strength 1.0)
PAPER_SIZE: tabloid (usually larger coverage area)
KEY_FEATURES:
- North arrow essential
- Property boundaries clear
- Building footprint solid or heavy outline
- Landscape often simplified to boundaries only

### CATEGORY: Detail Drawings

IDENTIFIER: Enlarged construction details showing assemblies, connections, materials
TYPICAL_SOURCE: Construction documents, technical references
PRESET: detail_drawing
THRESHOLD: 145
ENHANCEMENT: s_curve (strength 1.1)

KEY_FEATURES:
- Heavy simplification usually required
- Focus on major masses and edges
- Depth cues lost (describe in text)
- Consider if tactile version is appropriate vs detailed text description

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATION: Photographs often convert poorly to tactile. LLM should assess whether Image-Description-Machine output alone may be more useful than tactile conversion.

### CATEGORY: Axonometric/Isometric Views

IDENTIFIER: 3D parallel projection showing three dimensions without perspective
TYPICAL_SOURCE: Design presentations, textbook illustrations
PRESET: diagram
THRESHOLD: 135
ENHANCEMENT: auto_contrast

## 6. Decision Framework

### When to Simplify

TRIGGER: Image density exceeds 40% black after processing

ACTIONS:
1. Increase threshold (fewer pixels become black)
2. Apply morphological erosion
3. Use --auto-reduce-density --target-density 0.30

TRIGGER: More than 15 text labels detected

ACTIONS:
1. Prioritize labels by architectural significance
2. Consider symbol key with numbered references
3. Abbreviate where possible (KITCHEN -> KIT, BATHROOM -> BATH)

TRIGGER: Complex pattern/hatching fills large areas

ACTIONS:
1. Replace pattern with boundary outline only
2. Add text label identifying material
3. Describe pattern in accompanying text description

### When to Tile

TRIGGER: Original image dimensions exceed paper size at 1:1 scale

CALCULATION:
```
Letter paper: 8.5" x 11" at 300 DPI = 2550 x 3300 pixels
Tabloid paper: 11" x 17" at 300 DPI = 3300 x 5100 pixels

IF image_width > paper_width OR image_height > paper_height:
  ENABLE_TILING = true
```

TILING_OPTIONS:
1. Use --enable-tiling for automatic splitting with registration marks
2. Consider --paper-size tabloid first to avoid tiling
3. For very large drawings (>4 tiles), consider selective conversion of key areas

### When to Use Symbol Keys

TRIGGER: Many similar elements need labeling (rooms, spaces, structural members)

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Create numbered reference system
2. Place symbol key in margin area
3. Use single-character or number labels on drawing
4. Full text in key only

EXAMPLE:
```
Drawing: Shows "1", "2", "3" at room locations
Key (in margin):
1 = Kitchen
2 = Living Room
3 = Bedroom
```

CURRENT_STATUS: Symbol key generation is manual; LLM should recommend approach in output description

### When NOT to Convert to Tactile

CONSIDER_TEXT_ONLY_DESCRIPTION:
- Photographs with complex depth (stairs in perspective, complex rooflines)
- Images where color is primary information carrier
- Very low resolution source images
- Images with text as primary content (better to transcribe)
- Decorative images without spatial information

RECOMMENDATION_FORMAT:
```
TACTILE_CONVERSION_NOT_RECOMMENDED
REASON: [Specific reason]
ALTERNATIVE: Detailed text description via Image-Description-Machine
DESCRIPTION_FOLLOWS: [Yes/No]
```
